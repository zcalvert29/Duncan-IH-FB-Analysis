# Duncan-IH-FB-Analysis
Running analysis on Duncan/Sorin Interhall Tackle Football Play-by-Play to better understand the game at hand and prepare for the following week's games. Credit to John O'Neill and Zack "Vector" Tyler for keeping detailed stats and making this analysis possible.

Interhall Tackle Football is a Notre Dame-exclusive sport, whereby students on campus form a team within their dorm to play other teams in full-contact tackle football.
The sport is taken very seriously, with dedicated practices, playbooks, and games, to mimic High School and College Football.
Inspired by the increase in publically available football data, such as the R packages nflFastR and cfbFastR, and my desire to eventually work in an Analytics Role for a Sports Organization, I decided to set up a system to perform quantitative analysis on the games my Interhall Football team plays.
During games, Team Statisticians John O'Neill and Zack "Vector" Tyler will be recording play-by-play data to be transferred to Excel and then into Python for future analysis.
All analysis will be conducted in Jupyter Notebooks and uploaded by Monday morning after the Sunday games.
The goal with this analysis is to record an accurate, detailed, up-to-date story of the games we play, leading us to best understand our team's strengths, areas of improvement, and highlight outstanding players from the game.
We will use the analysis in practice to focus on strengthening our weak points and implementing better in-game strategies and decision-making to advance our team's chance of winning.
And we get to play football, so that's pretty cool.
